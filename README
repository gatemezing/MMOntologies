This project contains the source schema for the list (16) of some relevant Multimedia ontologies studied for 
the paper "The Landscape of Multimedia Ontologies in the last Decade", submitted dor publication to 
the journal "MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS"

We are sharing the schemas in github so others can easily see the ontologies for further study or for their any other uses, since it was founded through many researchs,
and someetimes the original links are not available now.


LIST OF THE ONTOLOGIES
We divided the ontologies in four categories: Ontologies for describing Multimedia Objects, Shape & Image Ontologies, Visual Resource Ontologies and Music Ontologies
1-Multimedia Ontologies
 COMM
 M3O
 Media Resource Ontology
 MPEG-7 Upper MDS
 MPEG-7 Tsinakari
 MPEG-7 Rhizomik
 
2-Shape & Image Ontologies
 DIG 35
 MSO
 SAPO
 CSO
 MIRO
 
3-Visual Resource Ontologies
 VRA Core 3
 VDO
 
4-Music Ontologies
 Music Ontology
 Kanzaki Music Ontology
 Music Recommendation Ontology

It is an experiment to see how well a service like github can work for collaboratively managing schemas.
